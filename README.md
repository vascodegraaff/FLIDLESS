# Flidless

The proposed solution speeds up lengthy airport procedures. The new Noida International Airport in India will welcome approximately 70Mio passengers yearly. In this scenario, every minute the airport crew spends on verifying the identity and flight data of each passenger can add up to years of wasted time.
Flidless effectively eliminates the need for multiple custom & boarding pass checks - by confirming a match of the passenger's personal data with their flight details, using a Zero-Knowledge Proof of Identity.
Thus, Flidless ensures absolute privacy with state-of-art cryptography and utilization of the Casper blockchain. Navigate through the airport faster and keep your documents safe in your pocket!
